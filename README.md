# lab2
In the lab2 ,there are several files:main.cpp, R.h, R.cpp, writeFilein.h, whileFilein.cpp, writeFileout.h, whileFileout.cpp, file.in file.out and makefile.

Among them, writeFilein.h and whileFilein.cpp will creat a file named "file.in", which contain the raw data .
R.h and R.cpp then will calculate the raw data.
Finally,writeFileout.h and whileFileout.cpp creat a file named "file.out", and write the result data into it.

Put :main.cpp, R.h, R.cpp, writeFilein.h, whileFilein.cpp, writeFileout.h, whileFileout.cpp , makefile in the same folder.
In command mode,type "make" ,ana all of them will be compiled.
Type "./main" ,and then file.in and file.out will be made.
You can use "cat" to check whether the data is correct. 
Type "make clean" to clean the .o and main.
